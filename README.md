## Requirements
The code has been tested with PyTorch 1.6 and Cuda 10.1.
```Shell
conda create --name efraft
conda activate raft
conda install pytorch=1.6.0 torchvision=0.7.0 cudatoolkit=10.1 matplotlib tensorboard scipy opencv -c pytorch
```


## Required Data
To evaluate/train RAFT, you will need to download the required datasets and put them in ```datasets/``` directory. 
* [FlyingChairs](https://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/resources/datasets/FlyingChairs.en.html#flyingchairs)
* [FlyingThings3D](https://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/resources/datasets/SceneFlowDatasets.en.html)
* [Sintel](http://sintel.is.tue.mpg.de/)
* [KITTI](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_scene_flow.php?benchmark=flow)

## How to run?
For training on 2 GPUs, run the following command. Training logs will be written to the `runs` directory, which can be visualized using tensorboard.
```Shell
./train_standard.sh
```

For running on a single RTX GPU, training can be accelerated using mixed precision, and can be done with the following command. You can expect similiar results in this setting (1 GPU).
```Shell
./train_mixed.sh
```

You can evaluate a trained model using `evaluate.py`.
```Shell
python evaluate.py --model=models/raft-things.pth --dataset=sintel --mixed_precision
```

### Quantitative Results
Comparison of the proposed method with existing
techniques on the Sintel and KITTI datasets. Metrics in green, blue, and
red denote the first, second, and third-best results, respectively.
